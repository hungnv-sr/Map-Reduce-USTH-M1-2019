Reduce is a parallel design pattern that consists to compute a value from a set of values. One big problem here is linked to the floating point representation of real numbers. Indeed, it is well-known that the sum of two floats is rarely correct! To obtain a "good" approximation of the result, many algorithms may be proposed. The goal of this project is to compare some of these algorithms, in quality and complexity.

**The constraints are:**

* use of C++ and Qt
* use of XML for the description of the experiments, and to save them.
